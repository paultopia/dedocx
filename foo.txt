 Immanuel Kant, On the Common Saying: That May Be Correct in Theory But It Is of No Use in Practice, in The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant: Practical Philosophy 301 (Mary Gregor ed. and trans., 1996).

 See generally Alexander M. Bickel, The Least Dangerous Branch: The Supreme Court at the Bar of Politics 19 (2d ed. 1986) (identifying countermajoritarian difficulty with claim that judicial review “works counter to” a “distinguishing characteristic” of democracy, namely “the policy-making power of representative institutions, born of the electoral process”).

 See Mark A. Graber, Foreword: From the Countermajoritarian Difficulty to Juristrocracy and the Political Construction of Judicial Power, 65 Maryland L. Rev. 1, 2–3 (2006) (summarizing political science response to countermajoritarian problem, which largely focuses on denying that courts can stray too far from preferences of other political actors or that their rulings would be obeyed if they did so). One gloss on this strategy is to argue that questions are often committed to the courts by other—allegedly more democratically legitimate—actors, like elected officials, in order to pursue their own ends. Id. at 5–8 (summarizing this school of thought). See also Corinna Barrett Lain, Upside-Down Judicial Review, 101 Geo. L. J. 113 (2012) (arguing that sometimes the Supreme Court is better at tracking the public will than are the elected branches). 

 See, e.g., Ronald Dworkin, Freedom’s Law: The Moral Reading of the American Constitution, 364–65 (2003) (articulating “mature, principled conception” of democracy which includes constitutional protection of rights against electoral majorities); Jon Elster, Ulysses Unbound: Studies in Rationality, Precommitment, and Constraints 88–174 (2000) (giving a theory of constitutions as tools for self-binding); Samuel Freeman, Constitutional Democracy and the Legitimacy of Judicial Review, 9 L. & Phil. 327, 329 (1990) (“judicial review can be construed as a shared precommitment by free and equal citizens to maintain the conditions of their sovereignty”). 

 However, even if the countermajoritarian problem is solved, there may be other democratic objections to judicial review. For example, one of the most interesting and potentially compelling objections is that judicial review undermines the practice of democracy by channeling those who object to current policies of the courts rather than to political action. Call this the judicial-review-as-crutch objection. See, e.g., Robert Post & Reva Siegel, Popular Constitutionalism, Departmentalism, and Judicial Supremacy, 92 Cal. L. Rev. 1027, 1042–43 (2004) (“The danger of judicial supremacy is not that the people will be deprived of the authority to decide a particular case, but rather that they will cease to maintain a vibrant and energetic engagement with the process of constitutional self-governance.”) This Article will not specifically discuss that here, mainly because it is an empirical claim that depends on unknown answers to several questions—could those who succeed in the courts have succeeded in politics if they had just tried? Are litigation and politics substitutes or complements? Is the extent to which judicial review suppresses political activism counterbalanced by the extent to which it promotes activism by giving those opposed to a result something to fight against, and those in favor of it something to defend ( the Author thanks his colleague, Stella Elias, for this point)?

 In fact, one might wish that the judiciary was more equipped to stand in the way of popular response to such threats or perceived threats. History is rife with examples where the public has hastily thrown aside the rule of law in fear of a threat to the democracy, from the Athenian affair of the herms/mysteries to Korematsu. (The Athenian affair of the herms/mysteries was a public hysteria following the mutilitation of some statues and profanation of some religious ceremonies, which was thought to indicate an oligarchic threat to the democracy, and which resulted in numerous persecutions.

 See, e.g., David Dyzenhaus, Hard Cases in Wicked Legal Systems: Pathologies of Legality 231–32 (2010) (suggesting that judges can aggressively read rule-of-law requirements into the law, even when the legislature means to abolish them, absent an extremely clear statement to the contrary).

 However, this is not to say that popular values and the constitution might not diverge. See generally Mila Versteeg, Unpopular Constitutionalism, Ind. L.J. (forthcoming 2014) (suggesting that values enshrined in constitutions are often unpopular in their states).

Pol. 1018 (2004) (summarizing research and offering additional empirical evidence for judicial conformity to public policy preferences). 

 Another argument that might be made is that judges tend to have longer terms than other officials, and are designed that way in order to be insulated from political control. But this, too, is a contingent fact about political states rather than a necessary one.

 Alexander Hamilton, defending judicial review in Federalist 78: Nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of the judicial to the legislative power. It only supposes that the power of the people is superior to both; and that where the will of the legislature, declared in its statutes, stands in opposition to that of the people, declared in the Constitution, the judges ought to be governed by the latter rather than the former.

 Many democratic theorists have proposed using citizen-juries to model deliberative public opinion, either to have a direct legislative role or an information-forcing role in political campaigns. See, e.g., Robert Dahl, Democracy and Its Critics 340 (1989) (proposing deliberative “mini-populus”), Ethan J. Leib, Deliberative Democracy in America: A Proposal for a Popular Branch of Government (2005) (proposing deliberative popular branch of government); James S. Fishkin, Democracy and Deliberation: New Directions for Democratic Reform (1991) (proposing “deliberative polls” in electoral campaigns). Similar institutions could be used for constitutional adjudication.

 The “cost” here is the sacrifice of their policy preferences. Citizens may not know whether other citiens are willing to defend the law even when they prefer the illegal policy. 

 That being said, constitutional courts in systems like the U.S. have formal authority: if the text of the law is to be believed, they have the final say on what the law is, even if in practice they may exercise their authority only with the assent of the people. This may give rise to an independent objection, based on an expressive idea: maybe merely saying they have final authority gives insult to the independent sovereignty of the democratic people. (For a general account of expressive meanings in law, see Equal Law in an Unequal World, supra note  NOTEREF _Ref366761550 \h 25.)  However, this seems implausible, because in democratic states the people still reserve ultimate formal authority over their courts through the power to revise the constitution, and even if a given constitution does not explicitly provide for that power, we can conceive of it as reserved as a constituent power, as, for example, was carried out in the United States abandonment of the Articles of Federation. See generally Alexander Somek, The Owl of Minerva: Constitutional Discourse Before Its Conclusion, 71 Modern L. Rev. 473, 477 (2008) (discussing the question of lingering constituent power after a state is formed).

 The people could even choose to treat the constitution as an altogether unenforceable statement of principles, as advocated by Seidman, supra note  NOTEREF _Ref368050298 \h 34. The point is, they have not. The U.S. Supreme Court has not forced the people to take it, or the Constitution, seriously. The Supreme Court does not have the practical, real-world power to do so. Only the people have that power.

 Of course, judges have been punished in the polls in the U.S. before.  See discussion supra n. _____. However, at least historically, there have been many fewer electoral removals in those jurisdictions where judges are elected than there are controversial rulings. Between 1964 and 1994, of 3,912 retention elections in ten states, only fifty judges were removed. Larry Aspin, William Hall, Jean Bax & Celeste Montoya, Thirty Years of Judicial Retention Elections: an Update, 37  Soc. Sci. J. 1 (2000). However, some scholars suggest that things have changed in recent years, particularly with the development of organized opposition to judges. See Brandice Canes-Wrone, Tom Clark & Jee-Kwang Park, Judicial Independence and Retention Elections, 28 J. L. Econ. & Org. 211, 214-16 (2012). The most recent data suggests that 2010 was a particularly bad year for judges—six judges were removed in 482 elections (then again, three of them were from one political controversy over gay marriage in Iowa). Larry Aspin, The 2010 Judicial Retention Elections in Perspective: Continuity and Change from 1964 to 2010, 94 Judicature 218, 224 (2011). This level of removal might be the start of a new trend. Or it might be an aberration: from 1998 to 2008, only 1.2 judges were removed on average per year. Id. Even so, six judges in 482 elections are still less than 2 percent—hardly a staggering blow to judicial independence. 

 Gardbaum, supra note  NOTEREF _Ref366760771 \h 6. However, not all weak judicial review systems need be new commonwealth systems in Gardbaum’s sense: the new commonwealth systems are also characterized by pre-enactment constitutional review.

 The easy answer, of course, is just that the people support the courts in Canada and in the United States, but not in New Zealand or Australia. This might be true, but it would be theoretically uninteresting. It is also a task for empirical social scientists, who ought to go to survey data to sort it out. 

 This is a point made by Kramer, supra note  NOTEREF _Ref366761034 \h 41, at 229–31. 

 States with weak-form judicial review might allow courts to shift the status quo, while still leaving the ultimate decision to non-judicial branches of government. See Mark Tushnet, Alternative Forms of Judicial Review, 101 Mich. L. Rev. 2781, 2784–85 (2003) (comparing Canadian Charter section 33, which permits legislature to affirmatively act to reenact unconstitutional legislation, and New Zealand Bill of Rights, which requires courts to enforce unconstitutional legislation.)  

 See generally Douglas W. Vick, The Human Rights Act and the British Constitution, 37 Tex. Int’l L.J. 329, 355–56 (2002) (explaining the procedure after a court declares an Act of Parliament incompatible under the Human Rights Act.).

 See, e.g., Kenneth A. Shepsle, Dysfunctional Congress? 89 B.U. L. Rev. 371, 380–83 (2009) (discussing strategic role of impediments to legislative action in U.S. Congress); see generally George Tsebelis, Decision Making in Political Systems: Veto Players in Presidentialism, Parliamentarism, Multicameralism and Multipartyism, 25 Brit. J. of Pol. Sci. 289 (1995) (offering general theory of impediments to action in various legislative systems). If the hypothesis given in the text is right, the effect on legislative compliance of giving a constitutional court the power to shift the status quo should vary with the number of veto players in a state’s system. This is, in principle, empirically testable.
